Normal pinball macines usually are 130x72cm thus I'm basing the boards on a 72:130 (or 36:65) aspect ratio.
Since I'm targetting a 1080px height screen, I'll actually use 5:9 ratio that avoids dealing with fraction of pixels, making the base board 600x1080px.

Add tilt function timeout
Add levelup delay
